This was a project for the Discrete Structures class in the CU Boulder Computer Science department. In it, I implement [Pollard's Rho](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PollardRhoFactorizationMethod.html) algorithm for integer factorization with [Brent's cycle detection method](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BrentsFactorizationMethod.html). I use the [GNU GMP library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library) for arbitrary precision math.

Compile by running `make`.

If you execute `factor_cmd`, you can enter the integer you wish to factor at the prompt.
